How to use?

Prepare kit-easy-tap command (cmake -> sudo make install should do it):

chown root:root kit-easy-tap
chmod +s kit-easy-tap

E.g. After that:

kit-easy-tap kvm%u:lanbr0 kvm_tap.txt \
qemu-system-x86_64 -M q35,accel=kvm -m $((1024 * 4)) \
-cpu qemu64,+aes,+ssse3,+sse4_1,+sse4_2,+xsave,+avx \
-smp 6,sockets=1,cores=3,threads=2 -netdev 'tap,ifname=<TAP>,id=n0,script=no' \
-device rtl8139,mac=52:54:00:01:23:45,netdev=n0 -rtc base=utc

and got qemu x86_64 KVM VM as normal user with TAP interface connected to lanbr0
bridge without any extra things.
